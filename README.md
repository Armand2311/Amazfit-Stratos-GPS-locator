# Amazfit-Stratos-GPS-locator
Simple &amp; effective radar GPS locator app for Amazfit Xiaomi android wear
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello guys, after a very hard work on Android Studio, here is my first version of a simple GPS locator for my Amazfit Stratos 2.
With this simple app , you can store your current location (for now or for later), and see the direction and distance to your point.
This could be useful if don't want to forget your car on a parking ! or if you want quickly store an interesting position for fututre uses...

Here's the first gps startup screen. A small info about satellites in view must appear on the top of the screen.
You can wait sometimes 10-30 seconds for this first fix.

Then the main menu.

In radar operation - the distance displayed on the center - the compass and direction rotates when you move.
